- Crypto Dashboard is my academic team project.
- At the top of dashboard, there is a drop-down list consists of 10 crypto-coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and many more.
- For example, if user select Bitcoin, then the dashboard provides the current and past data of Bitcoin such as All time High, 24Hr. High, 24Hr. Low, Customer sentiments and Market Price with graph interface.
- Graph Interface means at X-axis we have Date & at Y-axis we have Price.
- By using these graph interface, user study the graph pattern, up trend, down trend and sidewise trend of market price and use these information to decide when to buy or sell crypto-coins.
- In addition, user can also download the Excel Sheet which consists of market price data, which is useful in time series forecasting algo. to predict the future prices.
- And there is a Facebook library called Prophet, which takes two values as input and provide the future values.
